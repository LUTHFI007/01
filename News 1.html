	<p>The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), in a post on its official X handle on Tuesday evening, said that it has filed an official complaint with the International Cricket Council (ICC) regarding "inappropriate conduct targeted at the Pakistan squad during the India vs Pakistan match held on 14 October 2023." The PCB did not specify about the exact nature of the incident that it was unhappy about in the ODI Cricket World Cup match. India had defeated Pakistan in the much-hyped clash in Ahmedabad last week.

	The PCB also said that it was lodging a 'formal protest' over the delays in visas for Pakistan journalists who wanted to cover the World Cup 2023.

	"The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has lodged another formal protest with the ICC over delays in visas for Pakistani journalists and the absence of a visa policy for Pakistan fans for the ongoing World Cup 2023," the Pakistan Cricket Board posted from it's official 'X' handle.

	"The PCB has also filed a complaint regarding inappropriate conduct targeted at the Pakistan squad during the India vs Pakistan match held on 14 October 2023."</p><br>
